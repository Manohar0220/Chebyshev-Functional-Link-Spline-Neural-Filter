This project is to increase the nonlinear fitting performance of functional link neural network. 
Every System have its own cost function to map the output from input. 
The basic goal of this Nonlinear system identification is to make a neural network algorithm so as to match models on data that are disturbed with noise by minimizing a well selected cost function. 
Opposed to linear system identification where the disturbing noise is the dominant error, model errors are the major problem for nonlinear system identification. 
A new approach is suggested to enhance the performance of functional link neural networks (FLNN) for system identification. This approach, called Chebyshev functional link spline neural filter (CFLSNF), employs a spline activation function with flexible interpolation ability to improve the non-linear approximation ability of FLNN. 
The input signal is extended to higher dimension using Chebyshev expansion polynomial which have more computational advantages over other algorithms. 
To update the weights of activation function, an adaptive algorithm is implemented and the mean square error with respect to the iterations is studied. 
The effectiveness of the proposed architecture and algorithm is demonstrated through experiments.


This Project is performed in MATLAB Tool.
